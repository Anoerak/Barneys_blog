 	<p>As an introduction, let's start with 'what is a blog??' ðŸ˜‰</p>
 	<p>A blog, short for "weblog," is a type of website that features regularly updated content, often written in a
 		personal or informal style.<br>
 		Blogs first emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and quickly gained popularity as a way for individuals
 		and organizations to share their thoughts and ideas with a wide audience.<br>
 		One of the things that made blogs so awesome was that they democratized the process of publishing and sharing
 		information.<br>
 		Before blogs, the only way to reach a large audience with your writing was to go through traditional
 		gatekeepers, such as publishers or media outlets.<br>
 		With a blog, anyone with an internet connection and a basic understanding of how to create a website could
 		publish their own content and reach a global audience.<br>
 		This led to a proliferation of diverse voices and perspectives, and helped to usher in an era of citizen
 		journalism and online activism.</p>
