	<ol>
		<li>Keep it bro-tastic: All comments, posts, and interactions on this blog must be approved by the ultimate bro
			himself.</li>

		<li>No negativity allowed: If you can't bring positive vibes and high-fives to the party, stay away.</li>

		<li>Show some respect: Treat others how you want to be treated, and remember the golden rule of bro-hood: Bros
			before hoes.</li>

		<li>Sarcasm is the spice of life: We encourage the use of sarcasm and humor in all comments, just make sure it's
			not at the expense of others.</li>

		<li>Keep it clean: No offensive language or content will be tolerated. This is a place for bros and legends, not
			trolls and haters.</li>

		<li>Legend-ary rules: Any rule-breaking comments will be removed faster than you can say "Legendary!"</li>

		<li>High-fiving encouraged: If you agree with a comment or post, give it a virtual high-five by liking or
			commenting with a positive message.</li>

		<li>Show your bro-pride: Represent your love for bro-hood by using the hashtag #BroCode on all your comments and
			posts.</li>
